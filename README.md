# HarperDB Kafka Ingestion Guide

Simple project to demonstrate ingesting Kafka topic messages into a HarperDB table. To handle the orchestration, I am using Docker Compose to run Kafka + HarperDB containers.

To act as the test project, I am emulating a company that runs a eCommerce store that is already processing events in Kafka. We'll setup a new order status/tracking system using HarperDB with the persisted data from the topic.
